## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `M101-S001-R001-C001-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `M101-S001-R001-C003-rp.fit` -- very faint satellite

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)  -- BUT SEE BELOW!
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

I could not get these to plate solve even though I was able to solve one at nova.astrometry.net.
