## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `AutoFlat-PANoRot-rp-Bin1-018.fit` to `AutoFlat-PANoRot-rp-Bin1-020.fit` and `AutoFlat-PANoRot-rp-Bin1-001.fit`-- these flats look a bit different than the others, likely due to clouds.
+ `M101-S001-R001-C003-rp_dupe-1.fit` -- satellite
+ ALL NON-M101 DATA IS BLANK

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

If any images are missing information and you have been unable to fix them please list
them below with a short description of the problem.

+ All non-M101 images have no stars, so no WCS.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing, because they were unfixable.
