## Unusual images?

Nope, just bias and dark and they look good.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)
- [x] EXAMPLE checked-off box, please delete.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

These images will be moved to 2023-07-30 because they were taken in the same run.
