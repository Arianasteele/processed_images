## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All `M1` images -- dome in the way
+ `TIC_76798849.01-S001-R005-C001-ip.fit` and later -- dome

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Re-ran astrometry with faster timeout for bad solves, and re-ran patching after updating object list.
