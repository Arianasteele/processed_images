## Unusual images?

All of thgese are test flat images

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing special

## Additional information

+ All of the files whose name start with "AutoFlat" are dusk flats.
+ All of the files whose name starts with "some-flat" are flat panel flats.
+ The few called "CCD Image..." were some test images checking the alignment of the telescope and the flat panel.
