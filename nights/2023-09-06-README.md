## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `B`-filter flats with no `-2` in the name (dusk flats) -- these do not look right compared to the dawn ones.
+ `Groth-S001-R002-C001-V.fit` -- satellite
+ `Groth-S001-R003-C001-V.fit` -- satellite
+ `M71-S001-R003-C001-V.fit` -- terrible focus and some moveoment in dec
+ `M74-S001-R002-C001-B.fit` -- satellite

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Re-ran object identification after updating list.
