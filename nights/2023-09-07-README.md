## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ NO BIAS OR DARK IMAGES
+ `Groth....` -- all are out of focus, some are not well-centered
+ These are all either badly out of focus or on the wrong center:
  - `M102-S001-R001-C001-B.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R001-C001-V.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R001-C001-rp.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R001-C002-B.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R002-C001-B.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R002-C001-V.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R002-C001-rp.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R002-C002-B.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R003-C001-B.fit`
  - `M102-S001-R003-C002-B.fit`

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Several of the B images of M102 have no astrometry because there are too few stars. Doesn't matter too much because M102 isn't in the images. Also, the Groth images are bad.
