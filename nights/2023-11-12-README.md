## Unusual images?

+ Somewhat otu of focus:
    - `TIC_325653071.01-S001-R001-C001-gp_dupe-1.fit`
    - `TIC_325653071.01-S001-R001-C001-gp_dupe-2.fit`
    - `TIC_325653071.01-S001-R001-C001-ip_dupe-1.fit`
    - `TIC_325653071.01-S001-R002-C001-gp_dupe-1.fit`
    - `TIC_325653071.01-S001-R002-C001-ip_dupe-1.fit`
+ `TIC_325653071.01-S001-R004-C001-gp.fit` -- satellite
+ Weird cloudiness on `gp` images for these:
    - `TIC_353960022.01-S001-R003-C001-gp.fit` to `TIC_353960022.01-S001-R006-C001-gp.fit`
+ Images from `TIC_353960022.01-S001-R032-C001-gp.fit` to end have some weird doubling and then clouds. 

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Many of the images are missing WCS because there were clouds...
