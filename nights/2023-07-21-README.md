## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All of the flat and light images have "clipped" corners. The clipping appears to be the same for the V and rp filters but not for B.
+ There are only 5 rp flats.
+ `M101-S001-R001-C001-B.fit` -- this image appears out of focus and M101 is nowhere near the center.
+ `M101-S001-R001-C001-V.fit` -- this image appears out of focus and M101 is nowhere near the center.
+ `M101-S001-R001-C001-rp.fit` -- this image appears out of focus and M101 is nowhere near the center.
+ `M101-S001-R002-C001-B.fit` -- almost no stars
+ `M101-S001-R002-C001-rp.fit` -- M101 is off-center
+ `M101-S001-R003-C001-B.fit`, `M101-S001-R004-C001-B.fit`, `M101-S001-R005-C001-B.fit` -- very few stars, though supernova is visible
+ `M101-S001-R003-C001-rp.fit` -- almost no stars
+ `NGC-7790-S001-R008-C001-rp.fit`  -- faint satellite
+ `NGC-7790-S001-R009-C001-B.fit` -- many fewer stars than most
+ `NGC-7790-S001-R014-C001-V.fit` -- faint satellite

Delete this list if there are no unusual images.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

Images below have no WCS because there were few stars/too much cloud.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing special.
