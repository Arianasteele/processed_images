## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `TIC_260040728.01-S001-R034-C001-gp.fit` and all later -- either clouds or the dome
+ `ngc-891-S001-R001-C001-B.fit` through `ngc-891-S001-R003-C002-B.fit` -- sky is pretty bright (started too close to sunset)
+ `ngc-891-S001-R002-C001-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `ngc-891-S001-R002-C002-B.fit` -- satellite, parallel to previous, maybe StarLink?
+ `ngc-891-S001-R004-C002-B.fit` -- satellite
+ `ngc-891-S001-R005-C002-B.fit` -- staellite
+ `ngc-891-S001-R013-C001-B.fit` -- satellite

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Re-ran astrometry to speed up those doomed to fail because of clouds or whatever.
