## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ All NGC 891 images are badly out of focus.
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C016-rp.fit` through `ey-uma-S001-R001-C016-rp.fit` -- these images, without `dupe` in the name are either completely or partically obscured by the dome, I think.

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [ ] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)
- [x] EXAMPLE checked-off box, please delete.

A few images are missing WCS because they are of the dome or badly out of focus.

## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing special.
