## Unusual images?

Are there any images that look unusual? List the file name of any unusual images for this night here, with description:

+ `Dark-S001-R001-C001-NoFilt.fit` through `Dark-S001-R001-C005-NoFilt.fit` -- looks like there is a light leak in the firs several images.
+ `ey-uma-S001-R001-C001-ip.fit` -- horizontal banding
+ `ey-uma-S001-R002-C001-B.fit` -- horizontal banding and a bit washed out...actually, it is `B` filter, so just fainter.
+ `ey-uma-S001-R006-C001-ip.fit` -- parallel satellite tracks, maybe starlink
+ `ey-uma-S001-R007-C003-rp.fit` -- satellite
+ `ey-uma-S001-R007-C010-rp.fit` -- satellite, looks parallel to previous one, so maybe starlink?
+ `ey-uma-S001-R007-C014-rp.fit` -- satellite

## Missing information?

Check these off if they are true:

- [x] No images are missing filter information (except BIAS and DARK, which need no filter).
- [x] No images are missing pointing information (RA/Dec and WCS)
- [x] No images are missing object names (only applies to science images)


## What, if anything, did you have to do to fix images on this night?

Nothing
